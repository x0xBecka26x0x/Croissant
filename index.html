<h2>Croissants are awesome!</h2>

    <p>A croissant is typically made of yeast-risen dough. 
    The dough is first layered with butter and then rolled. 
    It is folded many times in a process called lamination. 
    Then the dough is cut into triangles, rolled to form a 
    crescent shape and baked.</p>
